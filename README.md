# Sergeant

A very very basic React Native app built to explore GraphQL and create a simple too for guiding me through a morning routine.

## TODO

- [ ] Make it not-ugly
- [ ] Alter the `sergeant-api` to operate off of a database and take step timestamps
- [ ] Add a `componentWillUnmount` timestamp for each step
- [ ] Add skipping functionality

### Distant TODO
- [ ] Drill/Step creation
- [ ] Users and authentication
- [ ] Task editing/deleting/reordering
